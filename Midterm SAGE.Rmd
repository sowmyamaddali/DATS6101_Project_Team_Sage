Brain Stroke:

A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

```{r}

dataset<-read.csv("C:/Users/Jerrick/Downloads/R Project/full_filled_stroke_data (1).csv")
head(dataset)
str(dataset)
```

```{r}

df<-table(dataset$stroke)
barplot(df,main='Distribution of Target Variable (Stroke)',col='Red')

```


So from the plot, we can see that the number of observations of 0 is greater than the number of observations 1. From this we can see that the dataset is imbalanced.
